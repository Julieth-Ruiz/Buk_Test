Buk_Test
This is the test automation project for the buk technical challenge.
To run the test correctly you must have downloaded the Java version java 20.0.1, download intelliJ (you can do it from this link https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) and make sure
that the dependencies of maven are up to date. Please note that in order for the Selenium WebDriver to interact with the Chrome browser, it is necessary to download the ChromeDriver file corresponding to
your specific version of Chrome and configure it in your Java project.
Here you can find the file according to the version of your Chrome browser: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
